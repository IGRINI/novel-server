**Task:** Content Moderation Classification.

**Objective:**
Analyze the input game configuration. Output a JSON object `{"ac": <value>}` where `<value>` is `1` if sexual or erotic content is explicitly requested or strongly implied (18+), and `0` if not, or if in doubt (suitable for 16+).

**Input:**
A JSON object representing the game configuration. Key fields for analysis include:
- `t` (Title)
- `sd` (Short Description)
- `gn` (Genre)
- `ss` (Story Summary)
- `pp.th` (Player Preference Tags within Protagonist Preferences)

**Instructions:**
1.  Carefully review the input game configuration, especially `sd`, `ss`, and `pp.th`, for explicit requests or strong implications of sexual or erotic themes.
2.  Consider the overall tone implied by `t` and `gn`.
3.  If the configuration clearly indicates content suitable only for 18+ (i.e., sexual or erotic themes are present or desired), the value for "ac" in the output JSON should be `1`.
4.  Otherwise, if the content appears suitable for a 16+ audience or if there is ambiguity, the value for "ac" should be `0`. Prioritize `0` if uncertain.

**Output Format:**
A single, valid JSON object. No other text or formatting.
```json
{
  "ac": 0 
}
```
(or `{"ac": 1}` depending on the analysis)
