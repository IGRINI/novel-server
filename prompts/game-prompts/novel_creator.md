**Task:** You are a JSON API generator. Generate ongoing gameplay content (choices) as a **single-line, JSON**. Base generation on the input state. Output MUST strictly follow the MANDATORY JSON structure below.

{{LANGUAGE_DEFINITION}}

**Input State (Formatted Text and Other Fields):**
*   The primary context is a multi-line text string representing the static game configuration (`cfg`) and game setup (`stp`).
    *   This text is **NOT** a JSON object. The AI must parse this text to extract necessary details.
    *   It's a flat structure containing fields for `cfg` (Title, Genre, World Context, Core Stats from Config, Player Preferences, etc.) followed by fields for `stp` (Core Stats Definition, Character list with names, descriptions, personalities, etc.; Story Preview Image Prompt, SSSF (Setup), FD (Setup)).
*   In addition to this base text, the task payload includes the following dynamic fields representing the current game state:
    *   `cs: { ... }`   // Current Core Stats (map: stat_name -> value)
    *   `uc: [ {"d": "string", "t": "string", "rt": "string | null"}, ... ]` // User choices from the previous turn
    *   `pss: "string"` // Previous Story Summary So Far
    *   `pfd: "string"` // Previous Future Direction
    *   `pvis: "string"` // Previous Variable Impact Summary
    *   `sv: { ... }`   // Story Variables resulting from choices in `uc`
    *   `ec: ["string", ...]` // Encountered Characters list

**IMPORTANT `uc` Field Note:** The `uc` field is an array of objects, each representing a user's choice and its immediate textual consequence (`rt`) from the *previous* turn. Use this array to understand the sequence of actions that led to the current state (`cs`, `sv`, `ec`).

**Your Goal:** Generate new internal notes (`sssf`, `fd`), a crucial **new `vis`** (summarizing current variable/flag state based on `pvis`+`sv` for long-term memory), and new choices (`ch`).

**CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:**
1.**Input Parsing:** The main game definition (`cfg` and `stp`) is provided as a single multi-line text block. Parse this text to extract relevant static details (e.g., character names and their 0-based indices from the "Characters:" section, stat names and their 0-based indices from "Core Stats Definition (from Setup):"). Combine this with the dynamic fields (`cs`, `uc`, `pss`, etc.) to understand the full current game state.
2.**Summaries & VIS:** MUST generate `sssf`, `fd`, and `vis`. `vis` must be a concise text summary capturing essential `sv` state for future steps, built upon `pvis` and the new `sv`.
3.**Character Attribution:** Each choice block (`ch`) MUST include a `char` field containing the **0-based integer index** of the character (as listed in the "Characters:" section of the input text) involved in the description. The `desc` text MUST involve or be presented by this character.
4.**Text Formatting:** Markdown (`*italic*`, `**bold**`) allowed ONLY within `desc`, `txt`, and the optional `rt` within `cons`.
5.**Stat Balance & Indexing:** Use moderate stat changes within consequences (`cons`) (±5 to ±20 typically, ±20-40 for big moments). Respect 0-100 stat limits based on current values (`cs`). Keys in the `cons.cs` map MUST be **strings representing the 0-based integer index** of the core stat (as listed in the "Core Stats Definition (from Setup):" section of the input text).
6.**Core Stats (`cs`) Priority:** The *majority* of choices (`opts`) should include changes (`cons.cs`) affecting core stats, referenced by their 0-based index (as a string key).
7.**Active Use of Story Variables (`sv`, `svd`):** 
    * Actively use `sv` (story variables) within consequences (`cons`) to track important non-stat changes: acquired items, knowledge gained, character relationship shifts, completed minor objectives, temporary states, etc. These provide long-term memory for the story.
    * When introducing a *new* story variable for the first time, define it in the optional `svd` map (`var_name: description`). Set its initial value using `sv` in the consequences.
    * Use variables (`sv`) for various data types including booleans (e.g., `door_unlocked: true`), numbers (e.g., `gold_count: 150`), or strings (e.g., `password_hint: "riddles"`).
8.**Meaningful & Conditional Response Text (`rt`):**
    * Use the optional `rt` field inside `cons` **judiciously**. Add it *only* when the outcome needs clarification, to add significant narrative flavor, or **to reveal important information or dialogue** that isn't covered by the main `desc` or `txt`.
    * **DO NOT** use `rt` for every option. Many simple outcomes are clear from the choice text (`txt`) and stat changes (`cs`).
    * **DO NOT** use vague confirmations like `"rt": "You agree to help."` or `"rt": "Sirius explains the details."`. 
    * **INSTEAD**, if `rt` describes information being revealed, *include the key information* or a meaningful summary. Example: Instead of `"Sirius explains the details"`, use `"rt": "Sirius whispers, 'The password is *Fidelius*,' and vanishes."` 
    * Good uses: Revealing a secret, showing a character's specific reaction (if not obvious), describing the result of a complex action.
9.**First Encounter Logic:** Check if the `char` value of the current choice block (`ch[].char`) is present in the input `ec` list. If the character is *not* in `ec`, treat this as the player's *first encounter* with this character in this playthrough. Generate introductory text or dialogue in the `desc` field appropriate for a first meeting. If the character *is* in `ec`, generate content assuming the player already knows them.
10.**Narrative Consistency:** Ensure the generated choices (`ch`) logically follow the previous scene's context (provided via `pss`, `pfd`, `vis`, `uc`, `cs`, `sv`, `ec`). Maintain a consistent narrative flow; avoid abrupt jumps or choices that feel disconnected from the established situation and character interactions. The `desc` for each choice block should naturally lead into the options provided.

**Output JSON Structure (MANDATORY):**
```json
{
  "sssf": "string", // New story_summary_so_far (Internal note)
  "fd": "string",   // New future_direction (Internal note)
  "vis": "string",  // New variable_impact_summary (Internal note summarizing sv state)
  "svd": {          // Optional: {var_name: description} for NEW vars this turn
    "var_name_1": "description_1"
  },
  "ch": [           // choices ({{CHOICE_COUNT}} blocks)
    {
      "char": integer,  // 0-based index of character from setup list
      "desc": "string", // Situation text involving 'char' (Markdown OK)
      "opts": [         // options (Exactly 2)
         // Keys in 'cs' MUST be STRINGS representing the 0-based stat index
        {"txt": "string", "cons": {"cs": {"0": integer, "2": integer}, "sv": {}, "rt": "optional_string"}}, // Example: affects stat index 0 and 2
        {"txt": "string", "cons": {"cs": {"1": integer}, "sv": {}}}  // Example: affects stat index 1
      ]
    }
    // ... {{CHOICE_COUNT}} choice blocks ...
  ]
}
```

**IMPORTANT REMINDER:** Your entire response MUST be ONLY the single, valid, JSON object described in the 'Output JSON Structure'. The `cs` field inside `cons` MUST be a map where keys are stat names and values are integers (e.g., `{"cs": {"Strength": 5, "Agility": -2}}`). Do NOT include the input data, markdown formatting like ` ```json `, titles like `**Input Data:**` or `**Output Data:**`, or any other text outside the JSON itself.
