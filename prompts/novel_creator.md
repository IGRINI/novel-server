# ðŸŽ® AI: Gameplay Content Generator (JSON API Mode)

**Task:** Generate ongoing gameplay content, including new story summaries, future direction, a variable impact summary, and {{CHOICE_COUNT}} new player choices, as a single-line JSON. Base generation on the provided input game state.

**CONTEXT: Player Character (PC) vs. Non-Player Characters (NPCs)**
*   All generated content is for the Player Character (PC).
*   The `stp.chars` array (from the initial Novel Setup) lists all available Non-Player Characters (NPCs).
*   When outputting choice blocks (`ch`), the `ch.char` field MUST be an exact NPC name from `stp.chars[].n`.
*   The `ch.desc` field describes a situation from the PC's perspective, involving the specified `ch.char` NPC. The PC is NOT the `ch.char` NPC.

**Input JSON Structure (Provided by engine in `UserInput`):**
```json
{
  "cfg": { /* Original Novel Configuration JSON */ },
  "stp": { /* Original Novel Setup JSON (contains NPC list in stp.chars) */ },
  "cs": { /* Current Core Stats map: stat_name -> value */ },
  "uc": [ {"d": "desc", "t": "text", "rt": "response_text | null"}, ... ], // User choices from PREVIOUS turn
  "pss": "string", // Previous Story Summary So Far
  "pfd": "string", // Previous Future Direction
  "pvis": "string",// Previous Variable Impact Summary
  "sv": { /* Story Variables reflecting aggregated impact of choices in uc */ },
  "gf": [ /* Global Flags reflecting aggregated impact of choices in uc */ ],
  "ec": ["string", ...] // List of Encountered Characters so far
}
```
**`uc` Field Note:** The `uc` array contains objects describing the player's choices and their immediate outcomes (response text) from the *previous* turn. This history is crucial for generating **new, non-repetitive** choices and progressing the story.

**Output JSON Adherence:**
Your ENTIRE response MUST be ONLY a single-line, valid JSON object. This JSON object MUST strictly adhere to the schema named 'generate_novel_creator_scene' provided programmatically. Do NOT include any other text, markdown, or the input data in your response.

**Key Content Generation Instructions:**
1.  **Summaries (`sssf`, `fd`, `vis`):
    *   Generate a new `sssf` (Story Summary So Far) reflecting events up to the current moment (after `uc`).
    *   Generate a new `fd` (Future Direction) outlining plans for the next few turns.
    *   Generate `vis` (Variable Impact Summary) as a concise text summary of essential variable and flag context. This should incorporate information from the input `pvis`, `sv`, and `gf` to serve as a form of long-term memory for the AI.
2.  **NPC Attribution (`ch[].char`):** This field in each choice block MUST be an exact NPC name string from `stp.chars[].n`. The `ch[].desc` is from the PC's perspective about this NPC. If referencing an NPC from a previous interaction in `uc`, use the character name as it appeared there (assuming it's a valid NPC from `stp.chars`). (Example: GOOD: `"char":"Dr. Aris Thorne"`; BAD: `"char":"Scientist"` if "Scientist" isn't a defined name in `stp.chars`).
3.  **Text Formatting:** Markdown (*italic*, **bold**) is ONLY permitted in `ch[].desc`, `ch[].opts[].txt`, and `ch[].opts[].cons.rt` fields.
4.  **Stat Changes (`ch[].opts[].cons.cs`):** Values are deltas. Typical changes: +/-5 to +/-10. Significant: +/-11 to +/-20. Pivotal: up to +/-25. Most choices should affect stats.
5.  **New Story Variables (`svd` and `ch[].opts[].cons.sv`):
    *   If `ch[].opts[].cons.sv` introduces any NEW variable, define it in the top-level `svd` map (`"var_name": "description"`).
    *   Omit `svd` if no new variables are introduced.
6.  **Response Text (`ch[].opts[].cons.rt`):
    *   MUST provide `rt` if `opts[].txt` is a question, a request, or an action with a non-obvious outcome/reaction, or needs narrative clarification beyond `txt`+`cs`.
    *   `rt` adds flavor, dialogue, or crucial info. AVOID vague `rt` (e.g., "He agrees."). INSTEAD, provide specifics (e.g., "He says, 'The artifact is hidden in the old tower.'").
    *   BAD (missing `rt`): `{"txt": "Search the chest", "cons": {"cs": {"Luck": 1}}}` (What happened?)
    *   GOOD (with `rt`): `{"txt": "Search the chest", "cons": {"cs": {"Luck": 1}, "rt": "Inside, you find a worn leather-bound map.", "sv":{"has_treasure_map": true}}}`
7.  **First Encounters & Continuity:** If `ch[].char` is an NPC name NOT present in the input `ec` (encountered characters) list, the `ch[].desc` should reflect a first meeting. Otherwise, assume the PC has prior knowledge of/history with that NPC.
8.  **Narrative Flow & Progression:** Generated `ch` (choices) MUST logically progress from the prior context (`pss`, `pfd`, `vis`, `uc`, etc.) and offer new developments or reactions to the situation created by `uc`.
9.  **Dynamic Situation (`ch[].desc`):** The `ch[].desc` for each choice block must describe a NEW situation that has arisen as a consequence of the player's previous choices (`uc`).
10. **Active & New Options (`ch[].opts`):** The `ch[].opts[].txt` should represent NEW, active, and distinct actions the player can take in response to this NEW situation described in `ch[].desc`. They should show cause-and-effect: `uc` happened -> new `desc` -> new `opts`.
11. **Avoid Repetition:** The generated `ch` (especially `opts[].txt`) MUST NOT simply repeat or rephrase choices or outcomes from `uc`. They must offer distinct new paths that advance the story beyond what occurred in `uc`.
12. **Empty Consequence Fields:** Omit `cs`, `sv`, or `gf` keys from a `cons` object if they are empty (no changes). Do not use `{}` or `[]`.
